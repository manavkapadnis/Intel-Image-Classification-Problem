This is image data of Natural Scenes around the world.

Content
This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories.
{'buildings' -> 0,
'forest' -> 1,
'glacier' -> 2,
'mountain' -> 3,
'sea' -> 4,
'street' -> 5 }

The Train, Test and Prediction data is separated in each zip files. There are around 14k images in Train, 3k in Test and 7k in Prediction.

I have used and fine tuned  different pre trained architectures and compared their accuracies in the notebook.
